cipollini
=========

Debian package selection (including scripts and extras) for a plug-in-and-forget Tor relay on a Raspberry Pi. Main features: simple config interface, stability, and won't mess up your video streaming or bittorrent.

THIS IS VERY PRE-ALPHA AT THE MOMENT.

Currently this repo only contains Pi-specific binary .deb packages of the latest Tor releases (experimental) that will work on a Raspberry Pi.  *If you don't trust binary packages from a random dude on Github,* you can find instructions to build them from source yourself - this will take 30-40 minutes on a Pi.  Please see https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en#source
