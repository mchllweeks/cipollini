This is a directory where you can drop snippets, bits and pieces that
aren't ready to ship, but that are necessary or useful for a Cipollini
node.  The first example is the 'fail2ban' configuration bits which
handle temporarily banning peers who connect too often; that didn't
spring forth as a fully-formed package, I'm just gonna drop it in
here and package it later.

I've created a number of subdirs in contrib which are for contributions
which may not be universally applicable across platforms - e.g. contribs
which only work on BeagleBone, or contribs which are only for very slow
machines, etc.

If your contribution is one like the above, please put it in the
appropriate numeric-prefixed subdir.  Otherwise, use yr best judgement.
